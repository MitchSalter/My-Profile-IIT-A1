### About me

Hello my name is Mitchell, My Student ID is S3856807 and my student email is S3856807@student.rmit.edu.au. I am currently 20 years old and i live in Melbourne Victoria. I was born in 1999 in south australia and moved up to the Northern Territory when i was 3 years old. I lived there for 10 years then moved down to New south wales. I continued to live there for about 3 more years and later moved to the final location where i am now, Victoria. My family consists of my Mom,Dad and little brother tyler. My Dad was born in England and moved over here when he was 10 while my Mum was born and raised here in Australia. My education to date consists of completing my VCE and graduating year 12 and also having a cert IV in Interactive Digital media.I have a white Shih Tzu named Oscar and my inrests include Photography and Gaming.An intresting fact about myself is that i have a massive scar behind my left ear which is due to a surgery i had when i was 15 where my inner ear was completely reconstructed due a Cholesteatoma. 

### Inrest in IT

##### What is my Inrest in IT?
My intrest in IT started when i was about 7-8 years old when i started doing IT at my local Primary School. I have always liked being around technology and IT since i was young age due to my intrest in Online games. I have never been a big Physical/Sport person as i dont enjoy it nor am i actually good at it. IT on the other hand has always captured my attention and i have always been drawn close to it. Every chance i got i would do the class in school as it was honestly what i enjoyed most. I dont have that much a lot of IT experience in terms of work experience but i do occasionly help friends with Computers such as repairing them and variouse other things.

##### What Did i choose RMIT?
I was oringally looking at RMIT when completing Year 12 VCE but decided to go with La Trobe as it had the same course and my best friends was also going there so that helped since i have anxiety and having my best friends with me would have helped it. Although after finding out i was moving to Ballarat which was now a 6 hour trip there and back for 4/5 times a week it become too expensive and required to much effort then it was worth. I defered from it for a year and later discovered OUA (Open Universities Australia) and found out that i can study online. I looked through the courses and Unis that offer this and came across RMIT. I chose it and here i am now.

##### What Do i expect to learn from my Studies?
Currently i am only doing 2 units. Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming. But what i expect to learn from my time at RMIT would mainly be the required and essential skills for a career within the IT industry. And inturms of my current Units i am studying would mainly be a general idea of each of the different routes i can take within IT and which subjects i can look further into and study more off.
