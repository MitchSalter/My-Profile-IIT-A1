Welcome to my profile for assignment 1 for IT, in this page you will learn about me, my intrsests in IT, Ideal job, a project idea of my own and variouse other things. 

### About me

Hello my name is Mitchell, My Student ID is S3856807 and my student email is S3856807@student.rmit.edu.au. I am currently 20 years old and i live in Melbourne Victoria. I was born in 1999 in south australia and moved up to the Northern Territory when i was 3 years old. I lived there for 10 years then moved down to New south wales. I continued to live there for about 3 more years and later moved to the final location where i am now, Victoria. My family consists of my Mom,Dad and little brother tyler. My Dad was born in England and moved over here when he was 10 while my Mum was born and raised here in Australia. My education to date consists of completing my VCE and graduating year 12 and also having a cert IV in Interactive Digital media.I have a white Shih Tzu named Oscar and my inrests include Photography and Gaming.An intresting fact about myself is that i have a massive scar behind my left ear which is due to a surgery i had when i was 15 where my inner ear was completely reconstructed due a Cholesteatoma. 


### Inrest in IT

##### What is my Inrest in IT?
My intrest in IT started when i was about 7-8 years old when i started doing IT at my local Primary School. I have always liked being around technology and IT since i was young age due to my intrest in Online games. I have never been a big Physical/Sport person as i dont enjoy it nor am i actually good at it. IT on the other hand has always captured my attention and i have always been drawn close to it. Every chance i got i would do the class in school as it was honestly what i enjoyed most. I dont have that much a lot of IT experience in terms of work experience but i do occasionly help friends with Computers such as repairing them and variouse other things.

##### What Did i choose RMIT?
I was oringally looking at RMIT when completing Year 12 VCE but decided to go with La Trobe as it had the same course and my best friends was also going there so that helped since i have anxiety and having my best friends with me would have helped it. Although after finding out i was moving to Ballarat which was now a 6 hour trip there and back for 4/5 times a week it become too expensive and required to much effort then it was worth. I defered from it for a year and later discovered OUA (Open Universities Australia) and found out that i can study online. I looked through the courses and Unis that offer this and came across RMIT. I chose it and here i am now.

##### What Do i expect to learn from my Studies?
Currently i am only doing 2 units. Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming. But what i expect to learn from my time at RMIT would mainly be the required and essential skills for a career within the IT industry. And inturms of my current Units i am studying would mainly be a general idea of each of the different routes i can take within IT and which subjects i can look further into and study more off.


### Ideal Job

##### What is my ideal job?
Although i havent got an exact idea on what i want my ideal job to be i have looked through some sites and have seen some jobs within the IT industry that have gotten my attention. After looking at Seek.com i have found a job that i may be intrusted in. Its a job offer for an IT Security Engineer at Treasury Wine Estates I will put an imagine of the job offer towards the end of this part of my profile. The reason this job is somewhat appealing to me is the fact that its in the security department, I have always been fond if Cyber/IT Security and my parents keep hastleing me to go into that department. So i feel as if this job is something that i would actually enjoy doing and not something that i will despise and not want to do.

##### What Skills will i neeed for the job?
from looking over the job advertisement i have discovered that i would need extensive experience within the security operations department as well as have extensive knowledge on different security products. It also lists that i will need epericen in now only log management or SIEM technologies but will also need to bve able to perform host-based forenseics that allowes to detect malicous artifacts. Lastly which isnt needed but to get a better chance at getting the job i will need to get a industry cerficicate.

##### What Skills do i currneltly have?
As it currently stands i do not have the required skills for the job in question. from the list of skills that i will need the only one that i have a somewhat understanding of is knowledge on different securty products. And even then its not that extensive as its only basic knowledge. but im hoping from the completing my uni course i will be able to get some more knowledege and meet the required skills in question.

##### How will i achieve the Skills?
My current plan to get the skills required for the job in question primarily revolves around my uni courses. I am hoping that from these courses i will get a better grasp at the cyber security department and learn some valuable skills that will allow me to perform my job to the best it can be.
